Week 5 Python Assignment
# OOP Assignment – Python

This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for a school assignment.

## File Descriptions

### DevClass.py
- Represents a base class Device and a derived class Smartphone.
- Demonstrates:
  - Class creation
  - Attributes and methods
  - Constructor (__init__)
  - Inheritance
- Includes methods for powering on/off, taking photos, and making calls.

### polymorphism.py
- Illustrates **Polymorphism** using a shared method move() implemented differently across multiple vehicle classes (Car, Plane, and Boat).
- A single travel() function is used to call move() on each object type, showcasing method overriding.

## Key OOP Concepts
- ✅ Classes & Objects  
- ✅ Constructors  
- ✅ Inheritance  
- ✅ Polymorphism  
- ✅ Method Overriding

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run the files using:

python DevClass.py
python polymorphism.py
